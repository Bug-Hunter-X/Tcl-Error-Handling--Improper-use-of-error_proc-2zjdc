# Tcl Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: improper error handling within procedures. The `bug.tcl` file contains code that calls an error handling procedure (`error_proc`) with an empty argument, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The `bugSolution.tcl` file shows the corrected code with robust error handling and clearer error messages.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `bug.tcl` using a Tcl interpreter. Observe the unexpected behavior or error.
3.  Run `bugSolution.tcl` to see the improved error handling.

## Discussion

The original code lacks sufficient error checking and doesn't handle edge cases properly.  The solution adds more comprehensive error checks and provides a more informative error message to aid debugging.
